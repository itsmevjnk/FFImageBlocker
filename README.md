# FFImageBlocker
A highly simplified image blocker extension for Firefox.

## Description
This extension simply blocks any attempt to load images and/or videos.
While this can also be achieved using any other Firefox extensions such as
[Image Block](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/image-block/) or
[Image Block X](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/image-block-x/),
this extension does not have any option regarding whether to block images loading;
instead, it will block all images/videos from all websites when it's enabled.
This may sound counterintuitive for users, but in can be useful in automation
scenarios where no user input can be given to control extensions and there's
no control needed.

## Installing

## Usage
